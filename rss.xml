Abstract: This paper introduces Llettuce, an open-source tool designed to address the complexities of converting medical terms into OMOP standard concepts. Unlike existing solutions such as the Athena database search and Usagi, which struggle with semantic nuances and require substantial manual input, Llettuce leverages advanced natural language processing, including large language models and fuzzy matching, to automate and enhance the mapping process. Developed with a focus on GDPR compliance, Llettuce can be deployed locally, ensuring data protection while maintaining high performance in converting informal medical terms to standardised concepts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
